# MultiColumnTableUsingSwift3

Multi column table using swift, will allow you to create a multiple columns with header in swift 3.0.
I have done it in very simple way, so that everybody can understand the flow.

Implemenation Details:

Create a tableview, add two table view cell.
One table view cell for header section and another table view cell for data.
Place all the objects in table view cell with tag value.

In swift/implementation file implement viewForHeaderInSection: delegate method to show table header values.
And cellForRowAt indexPath: for data.
